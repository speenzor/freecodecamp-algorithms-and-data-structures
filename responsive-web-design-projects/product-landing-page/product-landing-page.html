    <h2>A Rolodex for the Digital Age</h2>

        <p>On top of the desk of a mid-century man, you’d find a few essentials: a fountain pen, a framed family photo, a coffee mug, and, a Rolodex.
          <br><br>
          A Rolodex held a bunch of easy-to-access index cards upon which the user would write the contact information of folks who were handy to know, both professionally and personally. It wasn’t so much for friends and family, but for people who you wouldn't run into on a regular basis but you knew you needed to know.
          <br><br>
        Say you needed a financier. Or a lawyer. Or another person of power. Rather than digging through the phone book, you’d simply look through your Rolodex for the information of someone you worked with or had met in the past. You might not have regular contact with this person, but enough to know each other when a need arose. Through time and experience, you’d come to have a network of reliable folks in different domains who you could count on.
          <br><br>
        The Rolodex was an icon of efficient management of your most important personal contacts. In the digital age there is no perfect equivalent...until now. The Digidex is the simplest way to track these types of connections.</p>

        <p>This tool is meant to augment your email application, calendar application, phonebook, and social media sites so that you know when it's appropriate to reach out to important contacts. Put people here that you don't see on a daily or weekly basis and would like to keep up with. These are people that are important resources, but they still live on the fringes of your social circle and need to be conciously kept up with.
        <br><br>
          Use it like David Rockefeller used his <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-rockefellers-famous-rolodex-is-astonishing-heres-a-first-peek-1512494592">Rolodex</a>. David Rockefeller was a dedicated networker long before the digital age. But he didn't succeed at it without using a custom-built Rolodex. Mr. Rockefeller recorded contact information along with every meeting he had with about 100,000 people world-wide on white 3-by-5-inch index cards. He amassed about 200,000 of the cards, which paid immense dividends for him and his company.
        <br><br>
          Or use Digidex like how Bill Clinton kept a collection of cards for important contacts. As a young man, Bill Clinton began a collection of note cards upon which he would write names and phone numbers of friends and acquaintances who might be of service when he eventually entered politics. Each night, before he ever had a reason to, he would flip through the box, make phone calls, write letters, or add notations about their interactions. Over the years, this collection grew—to ten thousand cards (before it was eventually digitized). It’s what put him in the Oval Office and continues to return dividends.
