# freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Project- Random Quote Machine

This is the code for a Random Quote Generator using ReactJS as the primary technology outside of plain HTML and CSS. I had to do a lot of reading about the asynchronous nature of JS to understand how to use XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API, and jQuery's $.ajax.
Note that I developed this in CodePen and not using create-react-app, which is what I would use in a development environment that would eventually go to production (at least on a small scale project like this).
Thus, the files don't import any dependencies or setup the HTML file for use as an actual web-app. To see the final functioning application please go to: https://codepen.io/spencercorwin/pen/gBKrdW.
